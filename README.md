# nth_fibonacci_number

This short code calculates the nth Fibonacci number using *vectors*.
The method for counting the sum of the previous numbers is based on the written addition method.
(The Fibonacci sequence is calculated with: (n-2)th number+(n-1)th number=nth number.)

I might upgrade the code later with more features and better optimized running time, but this did the trick for now.
